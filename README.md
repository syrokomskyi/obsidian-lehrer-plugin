## Usage

To use the plugin, create a code block with the `lang` language identifier. The plugin supports several formats:

### Simple Translation

For quick translation of text, simply write your German text in a code block:

```lang
Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

The plugin will automatically detect German and translate it to English.

### Specify Target Language

To translate to a specific language, specify the ISO 639-1 language code first:

```lang
uk

Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

This will translate the text to Ukrainian.

See [Alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for a full list of supported languages.

### 3. Specify Source and Target Languages

For explicit language pairs, specify both source and target languages:

```lang
de
uk

Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

This will translate from German (de) to Ukrainian (uk).

### Visualising

To add screenshots with a frame (as already presented), we use [this service](https://postspark.app/screenshot) with the theme `Aqua Light'.

### Releasing

Every new version of Obsidian may introduce new capabilities for plugins.

We should touch these files:

-   `package.json`: `version`
-   `manifest.json`: `version`, `minAppVersion`

And (maybe):

-   `versions.json`

See <https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/Versions> for reasoning.

We don't need to list every plugin relese in the `versions.json`. We only need to update `versions.json` if we change the `minAppVersion` for our plugin.

In the GitHub repository was implemented automatically created release when we create a new tag.

Thanks [here](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Release+your+plugin+with+GitHub+Actions).

1. Create a tag that matches the version in the `manifest.json` file.

```sh
git tag -a 1.2.0 -m "1.2.0"
```

2. Push the tag to GitHub.

With command line:

```sh
git push origin 1.2.0

```

With TortoiseGit:

3. Browse to your repository on GitHub and select the Actions tab. Your workflow might still be running, or it might have finished already.

4. When the workflow finishes, go back to the main page for your repository and select Releases in the sidebar on the right side. The workflow has created a draft GitHub release and uploaded the required assets as binary attachments.

5. Select `Edit` (pencil icon) on the right side of the release name.

6. Add release notes to let users know what happened in this release, and then select `Publish release`.
