## Usage

To use the plugin, create a code block with the `lang` language identifier. The plugin supports several formats:

### 1. Simple Translation

For quick translation of text, simply write your German text in a code block:

```lang
Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

The plugin will automatically detect German and translate it to English.

### 2. Specify Target Language

To translate to a specific language, specify the ISO 639-1 language code first:

```lang
uk

Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

This will translate the text to Ukrainian.

See [Alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for a full list of supported languages.

### 3. Specify Source and Target Languages

For explicit language pairs, specify both source and target languages:

```lang
de
uk

Hallo, wie geht es dir?
```

This will translate from German (de) to Ukrainian (uk).
